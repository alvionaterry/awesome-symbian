Please follow the following guidelines when contributing, in addition to guidelines mentioned in Awesome Manifesto: 


1. The entry must be about Symbian. It is **not limited to S\* Series**. Entries related to general Java, Java-ME embedded, general C++, QT or anything else are NOT allowed. Please contribute J2ME related entries to [Awesome J2ME](https://github.com/hstsethi/awesome-j2me). Tutorials, academic papers, development tools are highly encouraged though any contribution is always welcome."

2. All links must be valid. If the original link is dead then try to link any archived version.

3. Please keep it legal. No pornography, gore, piracy or direct links to executables, keys or any other copyrighted material.

4. Entries of books, papers, tutorials should link back to the original site or any other reputable site, instead of a direct PDF. Examples of such include Google books, academic journal or university website. You can provide the download link in description instead. The reason for that, is such sites have more context about the resource which a random PDF lacks.
